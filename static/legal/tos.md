# Terms of Service for slop.minde.one Team

## 1. Introduction
These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the slop.minde.one Team community platform, forums, and related services (collectively, the "Services"). These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and slop.minde.one Team ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using our Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.

The primary operating language of this community is English. By registering, you acknowledge and agree that these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and all future communications or moderation actions may be conducted in English.

You acknowledge that the Service is operated by a private individual for non-commercial, hobbyist purposes. The Administrator is not a registered business entity. Consumer protection laws applicable to business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions may not apply to your use of this Service to the same extent as they would with a commercial entity.

## 2. Definitions
"User," "you," and "your" refer to the individual or entity accessing or using our Services.
"Content" refers to any text, images, videos, audio, posts, comments, or other material that appears on or through our Services.
"User Content" refers to any Content that users submit, upload, or transmit to or through our Services.
"Community Guidelines" refers to the additional rules and standards for participating in our community, which are incorporated by reference into these Terms.
"Intellectual Property Rights" means all patent rights, copyright rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark rights, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights, and other intellectual property rights.

## 3. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and our Community Guidelines, all of which are incorporated by reference. If you are using our Services on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.

## 4. Changes to Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of significant changes by posting a prominent notice on our Services or by sending you an email. Your continued use of our Services after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must stop using our Services.

## 5. Eligibility
To use our Services, you must be at least 16 years old. If you are under 18 years old, you must have permission from your parent or legal guardian to use our Services, and they must agree to these Terms on your behalf. By using our Services, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.

Certain areas or features of our Services may have additional age restrictions, which will be specified where applicable.

## 6. User Accounts
Registration is strictly by invitation only. Invite codes are a revocable license, not a property right. The Administrator reserves the sole and absolute right to generate, distribute, invalidate, or revoke invitation codes at any time, for any reason, without prior notice. Possession of a code does not guarantee account creation. We reserve the right to deny access to any individual, regardless of their possession of a valid code.

You are responsible for:
- Providing accurate, current, and complete information
- Maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account
- All activities that occur under your account
- Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account

You may customize your username, but you may not impersonate others or choose a username that is offensive, vulgar, infringes someone's rights, or otherwise violates our Community Guidelines.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at our discretion if we believe you have violated these Terms, our Community Guidelines, or if we believe your account may pose a risk to our Services or other users.

## 7. Community Conduct
Our community is built on respect, constructive dialogue, and shared interests. When using our Services, you agree to follow our Community Guidelines, which include but are not limited to:

- Treating others with respect and courtesy
- Contributing constructively to discussions
- Not engaging in harassment, hate speech, or intimidation
- Not posting illegal, harmful, or inappropriate content
- Not spamming, flooding, or disrupting conversations
- Not impersonating others or misrepresenting your identity or affiliations
- Respecting the privacy of other users

Moderators and administrators have broad discretion to enforce these guidelines, including removing content, issuing warnings, temporarily suspending accounts, or permanently banning users.

## 8. User Content
You retain ownership of the text you submit. However, by submitting Content (including anonymous posts), you grant the Administrator a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content.

You explicitly grant the Administrator the right to syndicate, repost, and adapt your Content (including text-to-image conversion or formatting changes) for publication on external infrastructure and social media platforms, including but not limited to Discord and Instagram.

To the fullest extent permitted by Lithuanian law, you waive any 'moral rights' or rights of attribution regarding your Content. You agree that the Administrator may use your Content without identifying you as the author.

While the Service allows for 'anonymous' posting, you acknowledge that this anonymity applies only to other Users. The Administrator and Moderators reserve the right to view the identity of the User account associated with any post. We reserve the right to scrub or permanently delete user metadata from a post at any time, rendering it permanently anonymous and disassociated from your account.

You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to grant us this license and that your User Content does not violate any third-party rights, applicable laws, or our Community Guidelines.

You acknowledge that all User Content is public or semi-public and that others may view, save, or share your User Content. If you do not want certain information shared, do not post it to our Services.

We reserve the right to remove any User Content at our discretion, particularly content that violates these Terms or our Community Guidelines.

## 9. Content Moderation
We employ various moderation methods to maintain a safe and welcoming community, including automated filters, human moderators, and user reporting systems. Moderation decisions are made at our discretion but generally align with our Community Guidelines.

You agree to respect moderation decisions, even if you disagree with them. If you believe a moderation action was taken in error, you may appeal through designated channels, but we reserve the final decision in all moderation matters.

We do not have an obligation to monitor all User Content, and our moderation efforts should not be considered comprehensive. The responsibility for appropriate content remains with the users who post it.

The Administrator defines specific time windows during which you may edit or delete your own Content (e.g., 15 minutes post-submission). Once this window expires, your Content is considered part of the Service's permanent archive. You acknowledge that you lose the technical ability to delete such Content. While you may request the deletion of your account (exercising your Right to Erasure under GDPR), this will result in the anonymization of your Content (stripping your username/ID) rather than the removal of the text itself. The anonymized text will remain in the archive in perpetuity to preserve the community narrative.

## 12. Prohibited Conduct
In addition to the requirements in our Community Guidelines, you agree not to:
- Violate any applicable law or regulation
- Infringe the rights of others, including intellectual property rights
- Harass, abuse, or harm another person
- Interfere with the proper functioning of our Services
- Attempt to breach any security or authentication measures
- Use our Services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose
- Access or attempt to access other users' accounts without authorization
- Post or transmit malicious code or other harmful computer code
- Scrape, crawl, or otherwise extract data from our Services without permission
- Create multiple accounts to evade moderation or restrictions
- Sell, trade, or transfer your account to another person
- Use our Services for unauthorized commercial purposes, including spamming
- Engage in vote manipulation or other actions to artificially inflate or decrease content visibility

By using the Service, you acknowledge that your data (including IP address and Content) may pass through servers owned by these providers, potentially located outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).

## 19. Limitation of Liability
Nothing in these Terms shall limit our liability for fraud, death, personal injury caused by our negligence, or any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Administrator (as an individual) shall not be personally liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of your access to or use of the Service.

You explicitly acknowledge that the Service is a hobbyist project under constant development and may contain bugs, errors, or security vulnerabilities. The Service is provided for private, non-commercial use only. The Administrator assumes no liability for data loss or the exposure of user identity due to technical failure or third-party exploits.

## 20. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless The Administrator, their volunteer moderators, agents, technology providers, and assigns from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such parties may incur as a result of or arising from your violation of these Terms, your User Content, or your use of the Services. slop.minde.one Team reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with slop.minde.one Team in asserting any available defenses.

## 21. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Lithuania. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be settled in accordance with Lithuanian law.

## 25. Assignment
These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of slop.minde.one Team, but may be assigned by slop.minde.one Team without restriction.
