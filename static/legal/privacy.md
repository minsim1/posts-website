# Privacy policy

## 1. INTRODUCTION
This Privacy Policy describes how The Administrator of slop.minde.one ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our closed community platform (the "Service").

We prioritize anonymity. Unlike typical platforms, we do not require your real name, email address, or phone number to register. Your interaction with the Service is primarily pseudonymous. However, certain technical data is processed to ensure the security and functioning of the Service.

## 2. DATA CONTROLLER
The entity responsible for the processing of your data is:
The Administrator of slop.minde.one
Contact: [your contact information]

## 3. DATA WE COLLECT
We collect the minimum amount of data necessary to operate the Service.

3.1. Information You Provide
- Account Credentials: A username (pseudonym recommended) and a hashed password.
- User Content: The text posts, comments, and votes you submit to the Service.
- Invitation Codes: The one-time code used to validate your registration.

3.2. Information Collected Automatically
- Technical Data: IP address, browser type, operating system, and request headers.
- Usage Data: Logs of when you log in, actions you take (posting, voting), and your interaction with other users.
- Cookies: Session identifiers and security tokens.

## 4. PURPOSE AND LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we process your data based on the following legal grounds:

A. Legitimate Interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)
- Security: Processing IP addresses through security vendors (Cloudflare) to prevent DDoS attacks and abuse.
- Community Management: Moderating content and enforcing bans based on usernames or IP addresses.
- Functionality: Maintaining your login session via cookies.

B. Performance of a Contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)
- Service Delivery: Displaying your posts and comments to other users as per the Terms of Service.

## 5. DATA SHARING AND THIRD PARTIES
We do not sell your data. However, data is shared with specific infrastructure providers to operate the Service:

5.1. Service Providers
- Cloudflare (Security & DNS): Acts as a Data Processor. Cloudflare intercepts traffic to filter malicious requests. They may process your IP address and request headers.
- Hosting Provider: The physical server where the community database resides.

5.2. Third-Party Integrations
- Discord (Webhooks): When you create a post, the text content and your username are automatically sent to a Discord server via webhooks. Even if you delete the post on our Service, we cannot guarantee its removal from Discord servers.
- Instagram (Reposting): As per our Terms of Service, selected text content may be converted into images and uploaded to Instagram. This data then becomes subject to Meta's Privacy Policy.

## 6. COOKIES
We use only "Strictly Necessary" cookies. You cannot opt-out of these as they are required for the site to function:
- Session Cookie: Keeps you logged in.
- Security Cookies (e.g., __cf_bm): Placed by Cloudflare to distinguish between humans and bots.

## 7. DATA RETENTION
- User Content: Retained indefinitely as part of the community archive, unless deleted within the specific user-deletion window defined by the Administrator.
- Server Logs: Technical logs (IPs) are retained for a limited period for security auditing and then overwritten.
- Account Deletion: Upon request, your account is disabled. However, your posted text content may remain visible but disassociated from your active profile, or anonymized, at the Administrator's discretion.

## 8. YOUR RIGHTS (GDPR)
You have the right to:
- Access: Request a copy of the data we hold about you (mostly your posts and logs).
- Rectification: Correct your password or username.
- Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"): Request deletion of your account. Note that this does not automatically erase all public posts you made, which may be retained based on our Legitimate Interest in maintaining the conversation history of the community.
- Objection: Object to the processing of your data for specific purposes.

To exercise these rights, contact us at: [your contact information].

## 9. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our technology or legal obligations. We will notify you of significant changes via a notice on the Service.
