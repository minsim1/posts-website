## What is bug bounty?

If you find vulnerabilities in this website, I (the developer of this website) will personally send you MONEY 🤑💸💰. However, since I'm still a student, don't expect the prizes to be big. Also, I have not left any security holes intentionally, anything you find will be authentic. One prerequisite for getting the prize - live in Lithuania. Keep in mind that I (the admin of the website) reserve the right to at any time remove a prize from the pool if someone has claimed it.

## The prizes

The following are the prizes:
- 50€ => Any access control breach, RCE, XSS or anything else I will deem "scary enough" (first-come, first-serve type prize)
- 20€ => Attacks that require a lot of human input, but can cause severe damage to the integrity of this platform
- 10€ => Any DoS attack

## How to claim

Contact the administrator of this website => mindaugassimukaitis (at) gmail (dot) com

## The shit that won't fly

1. "Oh, your website *would* be vulnerable, if you had only configured it poorly".
2. "Oh, this attack could *theoretically* be executed, but I don't know how/can't show the process".

## Important note

Attempting to pen-test this website directly (on post.minde.lol) may result in suspensions or other forms of banning. [The code is public](https://github.com/minsim1/posts-website), go download it and attempt any attacks on your personal machine.
